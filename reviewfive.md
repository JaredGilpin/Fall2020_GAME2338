## Summary

Child of Light is a party-based RPG game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and released in 2014 that combines elements of side-scrolling platformers with classic party-based RPGs. A battle system that features elements of real-time combat and turn-based tactics combine to create unique gameplay that rewards player intuition and planning. The player assumes the role of the Austrian princess Aurora, who wakes up in the mysterious land of Lemuria where she must wrest the sun, the moon and the stars from the evil queen Umbra to save the continent and return home. During their journey the player will encounter a host of interesting characters, challenging enemies and stunning environments as they quest to save the mythical world of Lemuria. 

The story of Child of Light begins with an intro cutscene: Aurora, the daughter of an Austrian duke, has fallen ill after her mother mysteriously vanished. She succumbs to her illness, appearing by all accounts to have died in her sleep. Her father is deeply saddened by his loss, but Aurora's soul is still alive and has awoken in the land of Lemuria. She assists the mysterious Lady of the Forest, who then tells her of a magical mirror that connects the real world and Lemuria. To return home, she must acquire the mirror in addition to the sun, moon and stars that the evil queen Umbra has stolen. While searching for the mirror, Aurora is made aware that her father, the duke, has fallen ill. This, combined with the flooding caused by a failed dam, has sent her kingdom into turmoil. Upon finding the location of the mirror, it is revealed that not only is the Queen of Light Aurora's mother, but Umbra is also Aurora's stepmother: the woman that her father married after her mother disappeared. Unable to kill Aurora, Umbra throws her in prison, from which she inevitable frees herself. On her journey to reacquire the sun, she encounters Crepusculum: a daughter of Umbra who is responsible for stealing the moon. After reaching and vanquishing Nox, the other daughter of Umbra, Aurora acquires the sun. With help from her companions, she defeats the evil queen Umbra to once again acquire the stars. With her newfound powers she returns to the real world, where she saves her kingdom by ushering them through the magical mirror and into Lemuria. 

Child of Light, while it does have a main story, also features several companions that the player can recruit into their party, each with their own story and personality. The first is Rubella, a jester who wishes to be reunited with her lost brother. The second companion is Finn, an elderly wizard who joins the party after the player assists him with curing his village of Queen Umbra's curse. After Finn comes Norah, the long-lost sister of Aurora who is later revealed to be none other than Nox: daughter of Umbra. Next comes Robert, a mouse who wishes to impress his love interest by joining your quest. Upon freeing herself from Umbra's prison, Aurora is joined by the duty-bound Oengus, a member of the beast-like Kategida race. Aurora is also joined by Gen, a goblin-like member of the Piscean race, and Tristis, brother of Rubella. Each of these characters offers unique dialogue during gameplay and cutscenes, and they serve to significantly deepen the lore and intrigue of Lemuria. The most prominent companion of the game, however, is Igniculus the sentient flame. His function is to assist the player during exploration and combat, where he can enable the player to reach unreachable objects during exploration as well as to hinder enemies and empower allies during combat. 

The gameplay of Child of Light is a combination of 2D platforming and tactical combat. Most of the game's exploration and story progression takes place outside of combat, where the player can run, fly and swim through the unique and expansive stages to find secrets, hidden treasures and collectibles. The combat encounters take place in separate battle stages similar to games like Final Fantasy, where up to three enemies can be confronted. The combat is similar to a classic turn-based system, except turn order is based on a character's place on a timeline that continues to progress until a character reaches the end, at which time they are able to take an action. Some enemies are fast on this timeline whereas others are slower, and each of the player's party members have unique timeline speeds. In addition, Igniculus can be used to speed up a party member on the timeline or slow down an enemy. The player controls up to two party members at a time, but can freely interchange their active characters with other companions in the party, affording the player the ability to build each character to fill specific combat niches, such as turning Rubella into a healer or Oengus into a damage sponge. Certain enemies, including bosses, have specific elemental powers and weaknesses, requiring the player to adapt their party's items and abilities. 


## Final Thoughts

Child of Light has secured its place as one of my all-time favorite games. Nearly every part of the game is charming and interesting, from the beautiful watercolor environments to the intriguing characters to the dramatic musical score. The art style of the game is the most readily apparent feature, and I think Child of Light is the perfect story and setting for the bright & painterly style that it possesses. Each of the game's chapters typically takes place in a new and unique environment, from dark & gloomy forests to arid deserts. Each of these environments has a unique feel that distinguishes them from reach other while still retaining the same excellent art style. Each area is a host to a number of interesting characters that the player can encounter on their journey, including the Magna the talking mountain, who herself has an explorable environment on her back. The characters in Child of Light all have interesting dialogue, backstories and motivations. Music, for me, is a significant factor in my enjoyment of a game and Child of Light does it perfectly. The musical score is a perfect blend of beautiful, moody, and somber. Exploration is accompanied by mellow and upbeat woodwind pieces, while dramatic and engaging story moments are accentuated by appropriately dramatic piano pieces. There was never a time where I felt the music was over- or under-powered, and each track had a unique atmosphere. Child of Light ticks all the boxes for what I look for in an enjoyable game. The only thing that I feel could have been ever-so-slightly improved would be the acquisition of flight for the player, which I felt occurred too early in the story. Had it occurred slightly later, there could have been a greater variation in the layout of the early-game environments. Overall, Child of Light was an immensely enjoyable game for me, and I fully expect to play it three or four more times if a sequel is ever announced.
