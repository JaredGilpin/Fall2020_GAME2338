## Summary

Child of Light is a party-based RPG game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and released in 2014 that combines elements of side-scrolling platformers with classic party-based RPGs. A battle system that features elements of real-time combat and turn-based tactics combine to create unique gameplay that rewards player intuition and planning. The player assumes the role of the Austrian princess Aurora, who wakes up in the mysterious land of Lemuria where she must wrest the sun, the moon and the stars from the evil queen Umbra to save the continent and return home. During their journey the player will encounter a host of interesting characters, challenging enemies and stunning environments as they quest to save the mythical world of Lemuria. 

The story of Child of Light begins with an intro cutscene: Aurora, the daugher of an Austrian duke, has fallen ill after her mother mysteriously vanished. She succumbs to her illness, appearing by all accounts to have died in her sleep. Her father is deeply saddened by his loss, but Aurora's soul is still alive and has awoken in the land of Lemuria. She assists the mysterious Lady of the Forest, who then tells her of a magical mirror that connects the real world and Lemuria. To return home, she must acquire the mirror in addition to the sun, moon and stars that the evil queen Umbra has stolen. While searching for the mirror, Aurora is made aware that her father, the duke, has fallen ill. This, combined with the flooding caused by a failed dam, has sent her kingdom into turmoil. Upon finding the location of the mirror, it is revealed that not only is the Queen of Light Aurora's mother, but Umbra is also Auroras stepmother: the woman that her father married after Auroras's mother disappeared. Unable to kill Aurora, Umbra throws her in prison, from which she inevitable frees herself. On her journey to reacquire the sun, she encounters Crepusculum: a daughter of Umbra who is responsible for stealing the moon. After reaching and vanquishing Nox, the other daughter of Umbra, Aurora acquires the sun. With help from her companions, she defeats the evil queen Umbra to once again acquire the stars. With her newfound powers she returns to the real world, where she saves her kingdom by ushering them through the magical mirror and into Lemuria. 

Child of Light, while it does have a main story, also features several companions that the player can recruit into their party, each with their own story and personality. The first is Rubella, a jester who wishes to be reunited with her lost brother. The second companion is Finn, an elderly wizard who joins the party after the player assists him with curing his village of Queen Umbra's curse. After Finn comes Norah, the long-lost sister of Aurora who is later revealed to be none other than Nox: daughter of Umbra. Next comes Ropbert, a mouse who wishes to impress his love interest by joining your quest. Upon freeing herself from Umbra's prison, Aurora is joined by the duty-bound Oengus, a member of the beast-like Kategida race. Aurora is also joined by Gen, a goblin-like member of the Piscean race, and Tristis, brother of Rubella. Each of these characters offers unique dialogue during gamepaly and cutscenes, and they serve to significantly deepen the lore and intrigue of Lemuria.

The gameplay of Child of Light is a combination of 2D platforming and tactical combat. Most of the game's exploration takes place outside of combat, where the player can run, fly and swim through environments to find secrets, hidden treasures and collectibles. The combat encounters take place in separate battle stages similar to games like Final Fantasy.
