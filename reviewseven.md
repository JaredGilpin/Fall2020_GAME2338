## Summary

The Immortal is an isometric action adventure game where the player takes control of a wizard who searches for his mentor, Mordamir, within a deep and dangerous labyrinth. The player will encounter hostile goblins and trolls who seek to block the wizard's path, as well as countless dangerous traps that can harm or outright kill the player. Exploration can yield rewards for the player to use on their journey, from healing water vials to magical amulets that unlock secret passages. The player must vanquish enemies, solve puzzles, and avoid lethal traps to ultimately reach Mordamir in the depths of the dungeon. 

The story of The Immortal is simple, but made clear very early in the game. The player begins in a small room that features a candle atop a table that conjures an image of the wizard's mentor, Mordamir. The player is told that Mordamir resides in the deepest depths of the dungeon, and is in need of resuce. However the image seems to be speaking to a character called Dunric, which is not the name of the wizard. Shortly after leaving the first room, the player encounters the body of a slain adventurer, from which a ring can be looted that is inscribed with the name "Dunric." Shortly after solving a few small puzzles and dispatching some goblins, the player discovers their first of many straw beds, which offer small snippets of lore in addition to granting the player a level completion code that allows them to return to this stage if they lose. These straw beds become a main source of plot knowledge, and they describe the history of the dungeon, which features a magical Fountain of Youth that was once governed by dragons. At the final confrontation with Mordamir, the wizard's mentor, he reveals that he is responsible for the downfall of the dragons that once controlled the Fountain. Now seeking to retake the fountain from the survivors of his attack 1000 years ago, he does not intend to let his student foil his plans. Defeating Mordamir then completes the wizards mission, whereupon he exits the dungeon and meets up with Ana, the daughter of Dunric who the player encounters earlier in the dungeon.

The gameplay of The Immortal is split into two parts: combat and exploration. The combat is simple and straightforward. The player can shoot fireballs at foes from a distance, though if an enemy reaches the player, a separate real-time combat scene is triggered. In this combat scenario, the player faces off against their opponent one-on-one and must dodge incoming attacks while striking the enemy with their sword. In addition to green health bars, red fatigue bars are displayed next to the characters. Fatigue gradually increases as a character attacks, slowing their attack speed. If a character's health bar depletes, they die. Outside of combat, the player can explore their environment and loot chests, open doors and solve puzzles. A multitude of lethal traps inhabit each area, from arrow traps in the walls to floor-based fire traps that incinerate the player. At the end of each stage is a straw bed where the player can receive a level completion code that will transport them back to this game state if they lose all their lives. 

## Final Thoughts

I found The Immortal to be interesting and fun, but it was oftentimes frustrating. I enjoyed the dark and evil feeling of the game, which I thought was a great distinguishing feature compared to other games of the time. As a huge fan of fantasy stories, I was immediately interested in the wizards, dragons and goblins featured in the game. While the story was quite simple and linear, I thought it did a good job at telling an interesting fantasy story. My main complaint about the game, however, was the severe difficulty curve. Combat was simple and the stages were easy enough to navigate, but there were so many instant-death triggers that it quickly became frustrating to try to figure out how to proceed without a walkthrough. Walking on the wrong floor tile or using the wrong item in the wrong place caused instant death, taking up one of the three lives available before a complete game over. Overall, I liked the game but I definitely won't be returning.
