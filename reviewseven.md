## Summary

The Immortal is an isometric action adventure game where the player takes control of a wizard who searches for his mentor, Mordamir, within a deep and dangerous labyrinth.

Shortly after leaving the first room, the player encounters the body of a slain adventurer, from which a ring can be looted that is inscribed with the name "Dunric." Shortly after solving a few small puzzles and dispatching some goblins, the player discovers their first straw bed, which offer small snippets of lore in addition to granting the player a level completion code that allows them to return to this stage if they lose. These straw beds become a main source of plot knowledge, and they describe the history of the dungeon, which features a magical Fountain of Youth that was once governed by dragons.

Now seeking to retake the fountain from the survivors of his attack, he does not intend to let his student
