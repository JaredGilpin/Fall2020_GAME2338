## Summary

Bastion is an isometric action RPG game released by Supergiant Games in 2011 that features fast-paced action, a bright painterly art style and a motivating storyline. Over the course of the game, the player will encounter many different enemy and environment types while they acquire new weapons, special abilities, and upgrade materials. The player can acquire special materials called Cores and Shards that, when brought back to the Bastion, offer the ability to create and upgrade shops and services. Fragments, the game's currency, can be used in conjunction with found upgrade materials to purchase gear upgrades, lore entries, and perk items.

The story of Bastion takes place following the Calamity, a massive apocalyptic event that destroyed the city of Caelondia and killed most of the population. The game follows the journey of "the Kid," an otherwise-nameless boy who traverses the floating remains of Caelondia. The Kid wakes up amidst the ruins and makes his way to the Bastion: a central point that the Caelondians were instructed to return to in times of peril. Here he meets the game's narrator, Rucks, who is another survivor of the Calamity. Rucks instructs the player to collect Cores, which act as a power source for the Bastion. These cores unlock additional floating landmasses for the player to explore which may contain additional Cores. 

During his travels amongst the floating ruins of Caelondia, the Kid discovers Zulf and Zia, who are members of the underground Ura people that were once in opposition to Caelondia. The Kid acquires a journal written by Zia's father, Venn, who created a weapon that was intended to destroy the Ura people. Upon finding out, Zulf feels betrayed, causing him to intentionally damage the Bastion and flee back to the Ura people. Little did he know, however, that the weapon was rigged to backfire, which unintentionally destroyed Caelondia. Rucks instructs the player to collect Shards, which are needed to repair the broken Bastion. After obtaining the final Shard, the Ura attack the Bastion and kidnap Zia. After venturing into Ura territory and rescuing Zia, the Kid reaches Zulf, who is being attacked by his own people for bringing the Kid's destruction upon them. The player can choose to leave Zulf behind and destroy the Ura or rescue Zulf and return to the Bastion. After returning to the Bastion, Rucks gives the player a choice: use the power of the Bastion to reverse time to before the Calamity, or use the Bastion to evacuate with the survivors to attempt to find safety elsewhere. The final cutscene depends on this choice- it shows the characters' lives before the Calamity if the Kid chooses to rewind time, or it shows the Bastion flying into the sunset with the survivors if they chose to evacuate. Regardless of this decision, the game then enters New Game+. 

The core gameplay of Bastion takes place on "story" stages where the player collects Cores and Shards, but there are some additional stages that offer tests of skill for each of the equipable weapons. On these islands the player can perform tasks specific to each weapon and earn prizes based on unique requirements, which include rewards such as currency and upgrade materials. 

The game's hub, the appropriately named Bastion, acts as a central area that acts as a resting point between missions. Here the player can interact with NPCs, who offer interesting optional lore snippets if the player gives them certain items found during gameplay. Obtaining Cores during gameplay allows additional areas to be created in the Bastion, which can host a number of shops and services, including but not limited to: the Arsenal for choosing weapon loadouts, the Blacksmith for upgrading gear, and the Shrine for activating difficulty modifiers. Later in the story, collecting Shards will offer the ability to upgrade these shops which add additional purchase options, additional perk slots or more difficulty modifiers. 

## Final Thoughts

I had a great time playing Bastion. While it was a relatively short game- I finished it in around 4 hours- I felt that the story and gameplay were succinct enough without being too short or lackluster. The storyline itself was introduced in a way that you didn't need to necessarily pay attention to it to properly experience it. This mid-gameplay narration style allowed me to focus more on the gameplay itself, which I thought was a good balance. The gameplay itself was smooth and I had no problems with navigating the levels. The movement itself was fine, but I felt that the isometric perspective may have slightly limited my ability to aim. The music was excellent, and the art style was exceptional, but I thought the main character's sprites and animations could have used some minor refinement to get them more consistent with the rest of the game. Overall, I enjoyed the game, and I can imagine myself going back to play through more New Game+ cycles to see how chaotic and difficult it can get.
