## Summary

Underhero is a 2D side-scrolling RPG platformer by Paper Castle games in 2018 that combines elements of platforming, exploration and "timing-based" combat with pleasant pixel-style graphics and a fun story. The player will explore many varied environments in their travels through the Chestnut Kingdom, from bright & sunny forests to cold & dark frozen mountains. Defeating enemies grants experience to level up and advance the player's character, and exploring hidden areas rewards the player with consumable items and unique treasure. Prior to beginning their journey, player comes into possession of Elizabeth IV, a sword hilt previously owned by the hero. Elizabeth accomplishes two goals: she acts as a guide, instructing the player on how the combat works and giving hints when needed, and she acts as the player's weapon, changing and upgrading over time as the player acquires experience points.

The story of Underhero follows a similar path to many RPG games: the player starts as a no-name adventurer who must accomplish harder and harder goals to become strong enough to defeat an adversary. However, in Underhero, the player does not take the role of a hero. Rather, the player takes the role of a generic evil minion who is tasked with upholding that archetypal structure. At the beginning of the game, the hero character dies, causing the cycle to be broken. The final boss (and your boss), Mr. Stiches, tasks you with returning three powerful artifacts, acquired by the hero, to their respective bosses spread throughout Chestnut Kingdom to restore the balance.  The player must, with the help of Elizabeth, best these three powerful enemies: Alexandria II the Moth Queen atop her great tree, Baron Von Gregory the undead warrior in Long Woods Manor, and El Salserissimo within Pica Pica Volcano. Only then are they strong enough to face Mr. Stitches. However, on their journey, the player is stalked by a familiar face: Grey Kid, an enigmatic character that appears to be the antithesis of the player character. After defeating Mr. Stitches with the assistance of the three previous bosses and Grey Kid, revealed to be the captured princess Cereza, the player faces off against the true final boss: Puzzleman, the strange gameshow host that the player encountered several times during their travels.

The gameplay of Underhero is a combination of classic RPG combat, side-scrolling Metroidvania-like level exploration. While the combat itself is not true turn-based combat, as is present in a game like Final Fantasy, it does have a similar methodical approach that the developers call "timing-based" combat. The player has a stamina gauge that fills up over time and is used to execute attacks and maneuvers. Attacking consumes stamina, while blocking and evading at the right time restores it. Incorrectly evading or dodging will damage the player, so it's a matter of properly managing stamina and executing moves at the right time. While there is no real-time combat, enemies patrol and navigate their environment like they would in a real-time combat system, until the player interacts with them, at which time an encounter with that enemy will begin. Successfully defeating an enemy grants experience points, coins, and a small amount of health restoration. Exploring the game's environments is equally as important as the combat itself, as hidden chests can contain coins, experience, or useful items. 

## Final Thoughts

I liked Underhero more than I expected. It was a game that had been gathering dust in my Steam library since I acquired it via Humble Bundle some time ago, but I'm glad I finally had a chance to play it, and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I'm not typically a fan of side-scrolling games like Castlevania or Hollow Knight, due primarily to my impatience with navigating the world, but Underhero accomplished a similar format without much of the annoyance that I typically encounter. I attribute this to the relative simplicity of the level design in comparison to those games, and the combat encounters also served to break up that monotony. The gameplay formula does not stray too far off the beaten path, but within those bounds I think it performs well.

The environments were colorful and pleasant to look at, though simple in many cases, even for a pixel-style game. The music was excellent, and it blended the vibes of old-school RPG games like The Legend of Zelda with elements of more modern platformers like Crash Bandicoot. The setting of the game was unique as well- the hub of the game was set in the "evil guy headquarters," where all the enemies in the game could stop for a cup of coffee or watch a movie. This felt like I was often seeing "behind the scenes" of the true game and it made the game world feel more alive and believable. 

The combat was fun for the most part, and I enjoyed the somewhat-tactical feel of managing my stamina bar and countering incoming attacks. However, at times it felt slow and awkward, as I often did not have enough stamina to execute more than a few actions in quick succession, and the enemies were balanced in such a way as to not be overpoweringly fast with their own attacks. Time spent waiting for stamina and waiting for enemy attacks often overlapped, creating odd downtime in nearly every encounter. I thought the combat encounters scaled well over the course of the game, increasing rather sharply in difficulty and constantly requiring me to learn & improve.

Given the one-and-done nature of an RPG story like the one featured in Underhero, I don't expect I'll play the game again but I'm glad I had the chance to play it.
