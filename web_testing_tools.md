# Web Testing Tools

## Tool One

_What is the name of the test tool?_ 

* Silk Test

_What company developed this test tool?_ 

* Segue Software (1993 - 2006)

* Borland (2006 - 2009)

* Micro Focus International (2009 - present)

_Does this tool do any test case storage/recording?_ 

* Yes - Silk Test can record to identify applicable data including keystrokes and mouse movement. 

_Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?_ 

* Yes - Tests, requirements, and test documentation can all be directly linked together, allowing tracking and change history. 

_If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?_ 

* Silk Test's Silk4J client works with Eclipse automation using Java, and Silk Test's Silk4Net client works with Visual Studio automation using Visual Basic and C#. It also allows testing of Java and .NET tools, including internet browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge.

### Tool Features
* Silk Test can expand on existing Selenium scripts, offering increased functionality.
* Silk Test can simultaneously test tools and applications across multiple platforms, allowing a single test script to be run against many different internet browsers, or against iOS and Android mobile systems.
* Silk Test's workflow is primarily cyclical, running between four stages: Requirements, Tests, Execution Planning, and Results Analysis.

## Tool Two

_What is the name of the test tool?_ 

* Watir

_What company developed this test tool?_ 

* Titus Fortner, Justin Ko, and others.

_Does this tool do any test case storage/recording?_ 

* Yes - Watir can record and export files, including XML.

_Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?_ 

* Uncertain - Online documentation is inconclusive.

_If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?_ 

* Water is written in Ruby and functions as an open-source Ruby library. It works primarily with internet browsers through OLE functions to test functionality of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari.

### Tool Features
* Watir funtions differently from other web browser testing tools, in that it directly runs a browser instead of simulating it.
* Watir began as an Internet Explorer test program in 2001, which lasted until the release of Microsoft Edge, at which point Watir halted active maintenance of Internet Explorer test functionality. It now supports Microsoft Edge in addition to other browsers such as Firefox and Chrome.
* Watir attempts to interpret intent of code inputs, following a "Do what I mean" approach to testing, which the development team uses to differentiate Watir from Selenium's "Do what I say" approach.

## Tool Three

_What is the name of the test tool?_ 

* Katalon Studio

_What company developed this test tool?_ 

* Katalon LLC

_Does this tool do any test case storage/recording?_ 

* Yes - Katalon Studio can record and store UI elements and actions for easy reuse.

_Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?_ 

* Yes - Katalon Studio's interface allows easy linking of various test objects.

_If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?_ 

* Katalon Studio works with HTML, HTML5, JavaScript, Ajax and Angular.

### Tool Features
* Katalon Studio allows users to install additional plugins to further expand testing functionality and to optimize automation.
* Katalon Studio works well with other testing and bug reporting software, including Jira and Git.
* Katalon offers both a "codeless" visual experience for automation beginners, while also offering support for script-based automation for those more adept with the software.
