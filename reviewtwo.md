## Summary

God's Trigger is a top-down game created by One More Level and released in 2018 that features tactical combat, stealth, and action. The primary game mode is the campaign, which allows the player to experience a story involving Judy, a demon, and Harry, an angel. Playing and successfully completing content within the campaign unlocks addition content in the secondary game mode: the arcade. In the arcade, the player can replay levels of the campaign with new and interesting enemy encounters, enabling the player to hone their skills and gain additional experience to unlock new abilities. 

The campaign's story follows Judy and Harry as they team up to hunt down the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in an effort to stop them from enacting their sinister plans of destruction and domination. The first Horseman encountered, Pestilence, takes the form of an actor named Lance Pesting who occupies a Wild West film set. The player must elimintate his possessed cowboy cronies to eventually reach and defeat him in a drug-induced alternate dimension. The second Horseman, Famine, takes the form of a massive gluttonous woman in an underground cavern, where she plans to use create a fleet of killer worms to take over the planet. After using the grills meant for food against her, the player prods her for information about the other Horsemen. The third Horseman, Death, is a ruthless biker that occupies a steel mill. After interrupting his attempts to send the human population into a murderous frenzy using special drugs, the player proceeds to find the fourth Horseman: War. She occupies a high-tech military base and plans to use nuclear missiles to incite violence in the world. Ultimately the player travels to Heaven to discover the betrayal of the archangel Gabriel: the mastermind who required the defeat of the Horseman to enact his plan of world domination. Freeing and acquiring the assistance of the previously defeated Horsemen, the player fights through Heaven to reach and defeat Gabriel. 

God's Trigger's gameplay features stealth, tactical combat and fast-paced action. The player can navigate through each stage using a mix of stealth takedowns, queued attack sequences, and just plain old gunfire. During gameplay, the player can freely swap between Judy and Harry. Each character has unique abilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Judy is equipped with a long-rage whip attack and the ability to teleport through certain surfaces, as well as magical abilities such as clone creation and mind control. Harry is equipped with a short-range sword attack, a quick dash ability and magical abilites such as time control and invisiblity. In addition to each characters unique attributes, the player can accomplish their goals using environmental features like breakable walls and explosive barrels as well as limited-use weapons dropped by enemies such as shotguns, grenades, and shields.

While the combat is the primary focus of God's Trigger, there are also minor elements of exploration and collection. The player is rewarded for finding alternate routes through the levels that can include breakable barriers, side passages and environmental hazards. In addition, each level contains a hidden chest that contains a perk, multiple chests that contain experience points, and a hidden magazine collectible. 

## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed my experience playing God's Trigger. While this genre is not the type of game I often seek out to play for myself, I thought it was rewarding and exciting to play and I liked the ability to freely switch between stealty, tactical, and action combat styles. The top-down perspective definitely leant itself well to the player's need for information about enemy positioning and behavior. Character development was excellent, as there were a half-dozen special abilites per character in addition to their main attack and movement skills- all of which could be customized before each stage to give each ability boosts such as wider range or longer duration. After nearly every stage I acquired something new, giving me an incentive to see what was "around the next corner." This customization allowed me to freely experiment with different play styles to determine what I enjoyed the most. It nearly nudged the game in the RPG direction, but it ended up feeling more like customizing a loadout than advancing a character, which I thought was the better of the two. 

While there was more good than bad in my experience, there were a few things that consistently made the game frustrating for me to play. 

Firstly, there were some issues when it came to game stability. On several occasions, I completely lost control of my character and had to wait until an enemy killed me before I could continue. In one case I was completely unable to interact with the game at all but my character was unable to die, forcing me to force-quit the game and restart the level.

Secondly, and more prominently, I felt that the three core gameplay styles- stealth, tactics, and action combat- did not work particularly well with each other. There were stealth elements, but not enough to work well as a stealth game. There were tactical elements, but not enough to work as a tactical game. There were action elements, but the lightning-fast reflexes of the AI and the instant death from even the slightest error prevented it from being a truly fun hack-and-slash game. I felt the three didn't work cohesively with each other, which often lead to me getting frustrated that I couldn't focus on one style effectively. 

Other minor gripes would include:
#The collectible magazines, which included very suggestive imagery. In another game that had a reputation for being obscene, such as Borderlands, this would have made sense in the context. Here, however, it didn't add anything and felt borderline gratuitous. 

Overall however, I enjoyed my experience playing God's Trigger but I don't expect I'll return for subsequent playthroughs.
