## Summary

PAGAN: Autogeny is an "experimental first person open world role playing" game developed by Oleander Garden and released in 2019. The third game of the PAGAN avant-garde indie game series, PAGAN: Autogeny takes place in the crumbling and glitching remains of a long-abandoned fantasy MMORPG. The player can navigate their environments in a standard first-person fashion, traveling between several major areas while picking up items, defeating enemies, and uncovering secrets and lore. The dominant fantasy themes and sensibilites intertwine with elements of horror and science-fiction to create a unique experience that the developer calls an "exercise in aesthetic maximalism." A loosely defined story and a relatively limited number of gameplay elements combine into an interesting and motivating adventure. 

The story of PAGAN: Autogeny is loosely defined at best. There are very few indicators in-game of a central plot or story, so it feels as though the true story of the game is left up to interpretation by the player, if in fact there is intended to be a central story at all. On the game's page on itch.io, the developer describes the game as follows: "A thousand worlds surround our own, composed of bits and bytes. When they die, where do they go; what secrets do they hide?" While this may not be an accurate description of a core narrative, I believe it forms a basis for understanding the various bits of lore and story that the player can find. The first sentence describes the setting: that of a long-dead digital world. The second sentence loosely describes an objective: discover what the remains of such a dead world might hold. Indeed, upon launching the game, on-screen text indicates that the player is logging on to something called PLAZA 96 under the name VIVIAN: a name mentioned several times by various "NPCs" in the game. 

Though the narrative itself is vague at best, the one core objective that the game seems to focus on is the release of a "martyr." In one of the stages there is a stone torso on a wall, seemingly missing the head and limbs. The player can find these limbs throughout different parts of the game, at which time they can re-assemble the statue. This prompts the statue to fly into the sky in some kind of strange ritual, ending the game and closing the program. At first glance this would appear to have been the release of the martyr, but after re-launching the game, several in-game prompts indicate that the martyr is still restrained. Gathering a specific set of tarot cards and activating an altar prompts the same statue-building process to result in a similar ritual that frees the martyr. The game does not end there, however, as there are several more endings with various  levels of ambiguity that only seem to deepen the mystery. 

The gameplay of PAGAN: Autogeny is simple and easy to understand. The player can find and equip four different weapons and four different pieces of armor in addition to any 2 of the 22 tarot cards. Each of these pieces of equipment increases or decreases one or more of the five core combat stats: Strength, Faith, Defense, Pierce and Speed. Each of these has a direct impact on things like melee damage dealt or damage taken. In addition to the combat stats, the player has five unusual character skills: Estrogen, Body Forging, Caffeine, Poetry, and Murder. These skills are leveled either by collecting items found in the world or performing relevant actions. For example, Body Forging is increased by assembling the martyr statue and Murder is increased by slaying NPCs. For the most part however, these skills don't appear to have a profound, or even noticeable, impact on gameplay. In one instance, having level 10 in every stat is required to unlock a specific door, but byeond this they don't seem to have much impact. NPCs are few and far between, rarely offering more than a snippet of lore. Enemies are primarily in the form of bosses, from the strange magic-wielding ogre shaman to a colossal Scarab Lord. The vanquishing of enemies is important to the "story" progression of PAGAN: Autogeny but does not occupy a significant place in overall gameplay.

## Final Thoughts

I received PAGAN: Autogeny as part of a massive bundle on itch.io. As I searched through this repository for a fantasy game, I was intrigued by the strange name and odd screenshots of this game in particular, and I'm glad I chose to play it. It's a strange game, perhaps one of the strangest ones I've ever played, but I thoroughly enjoyed the vague narrative and unexplained story elements. It's weird, mildly unsettling, and immensely interesting. The gameplay was smooth, the combat was unoffensive and there was a decent mix of armor and weapon options. The story, while it was unclear, was interesting enough to make me want to seek out NPCs and lore entries throughout the game to try to patch something together.
